summary: "Announcement of the site's expansion from parsing to broader considerations of language, meaning, and complexity theory."

The format is changing from a narrow focus on parsing to a broader consideration of language and meaning, and the relationship of both to complexity theory.

I hope the site retains the terse, aphoristic style. And I hope the content remains useful to the reader.
