# Intelligence Defined as Prediction

One of the most compelling approaches to understanding intelligence is through the lens of prediction. Rather than viewing intelligence as a static property or collection of abilities, we can understand it as fundamentally about the capacity to anticipate future states based on current information.

## The Predictive Framework

This perspective suggests that intelligent systems, whether biological or artificial, are essentially prediction machines. They:

- Gather information from their environment
- Build internal models of how the world works
- Use these models to anticipate future events
- Update their models based on prediction errors

## Implications for Language

When we apply this framework to language, fascinating patterns emerge. Grammar itself can be seen as a predictive system - each word constrains the possibilities for what comes next, creating a complex web of expectations and surprises.

## Connection to Chaos Theory

The relationship between prediction and chaos theory is particularly interesting. Even in deterministic chaotic systems, long-term prediction becomes impossible due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This suggests fundamental limits to intelligence as traditionally conceived.
