# About Chaotic Language

This site explores the fascinating intersection of chaos theory, linguistics, and complex systems science.

## Background

The research presented here builds on work from complexity science, cognitive linguistics, and dynamical systems theory to understand how language and meaning emerge from chaotic, non-linear processes.

## Topics Covered

- **Chaos Theory in Language**: How deterministic chaos manifests in linguistic systems
- **Emergent Grammar**: Understanding grammar as an emergent property rather than fixed rules
- **Complex Systems**: Applying complexity science to cognitive and linguistic phenomena
- **Prediction and Intelligence**: The role of prediction in defining and understanding intelligence
